# Leaf_Disease_Detection

• Developed a Machine Learning model that detects disease of a leaf based on trained dataset.

• Implemented GUI using Tkinter.

• Trained model on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using TensorFlow.

• The trained model is tested with around 7000 images to estimate the loss of model and extra convolutional
layers are added and achieved an accuracy of 92%.
